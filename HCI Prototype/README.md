# Semester Long Project

In a team, you will propose a topic, gather data from users to understand the problem, prototype a solution, and then communicate your ideas.

__The final design can be found in the Digital Mockup pdf.__

## Heart of the Problem
In the first 8 weeks, you'll focus on exploring the problem space, including interviewing at least 3 users and doing qualitative data analysis. You'll learn what their pain points are and get to the heart of what's causing them. 

### Process
1. Perform Contexual Inquery with a user where they would natrually use the system.
2. Repeat step 1 until enough data is gathered to create an affinity diagram.
3. Take data gathered and group elements of positive, negative, and neutral reactions to the current system. Use this to create an affinity diagram and determine what current users want in the new system.

### Major Takeaways
- Current system for planning, adding, and registering for classes requires 3 different websites when it could be combined into 1
- The site used to plan schedule works as needed but the transfering of classes from the planning site to the registering site is complicated and confusing
- Students, especially those who have completed the registering process for other universities, want a cohesive website to do everything (plan, register, and pay)

## Getting the Design Right
In the next ~6 weeks, you'll brainstorm solutions, create low-fidelity paper prototypes, and conduct user tests with at least 3 users. You'll iterate rapidly in response to how people interact with your designs, and will create a digital mockup for your last iteration. __Our design ideas and reasoning are presented in the Getting the Design Right document.__

### Process
1. Create a paper prototype that fits the needs of users based on the affinity diagram from Heart of the Problem
2. Perform a Usability Test with a standard user in a comfortable environment
3. Update prototype based on information and data gathered from usability test
4. Repeat 2 & 3 until prototype is ready to be pitched

### Major Takeaways
- Our system should be able to plan, register, and pay for classes all from one site
- Our planning segment should be able to filter classes by different elements, show classes in a calendar view, and should be able to allow user to import personal calendar to view in comparison with class calander.
- Our registration segment should allow users to add classes directly using class number as well as import classes from the planning segment. Users should be able to clearly see what classes they are registered for and what classes they have in "their cart". Users should be able to see a tuition estimate based on both the classes they are registered for and the classes in "their cart"
- Our payment segment will need to be able to show user what classes they are paying for and how much each class is, the cost of additional fees, and any reductions from scholarships or loans.

## Video Pitch

In the final weeks of the course, you'll create a short video to present the problem, your solution, and your design process.

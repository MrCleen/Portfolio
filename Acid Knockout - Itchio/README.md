# Acid Knockout
We were given 10 weeks to create a "traditional" style game using "traditional" techniques. One of the most important outcomes of this class was a solid portfolio piece that shows off my contribution to the game project this semester. This includes both a playable build and a comprehensive set of visual materials to show off my project.

Acid Knockout is a king of the hill style game with a cute-horror art style designed to encompass the basic functionality of traditional games like Super Smash Bros. Ultimate (2018), and Brawlhallo (2014). The art style is retro cute-horror inspired by Mega Man Legacy Collection 2 (2015) and ACA Neo-Geo Metal Slug V (2013). The game is designed around a core gameplay loop that involves a static level with fast-paced waves of spawning enemies and pickups.

__Role: Lead UI/UX Developer and Creator__

__What I did__
- Created every art peice (drawings, custom text, etc)
- Programmed functionality of every interface element (buttons, playables, etc)
- Every single line in the .xml file was written by me
- Every single art element seen in the game was created by me

Given 6 weeks over the summer semester, we were tasked with creating a game in Tabletop Simulator that provided some form of alternative value.

My team and I decided, as college students, we were not really taught how to properly budget or make good meal choices. We determined we could use XML and images to make a version of Oregan Trail that would walk the player through a day in the life of a college student. We wanted the player to be able to choose, for every meal, whether they cooked, ate out, or skipped eating. At the very end, we would calculate how much money they spent and how much nutrition they ate throughout the day. We included some playable components where the player would learn how to cook things so they could use the information in real life. 

The XML code can be found in this repo along with a video playthrough and some images. Additionally, you can play the game by downloading Tabletop Simulator and using this link to subscribe to the game via the Workshop [Food for Thought](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2567944407)
